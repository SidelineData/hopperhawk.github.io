I have been working on HopperHawk on and off in my (limited) free time for a while now, and have finally reached a point where I can share it with others!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;version-10&quot;&gt;Version 1.0&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;specifications&quot;&gt;Specifications&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Based on the ESP32&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Support for an 18650 Lithium Ion battery&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Uses the TOF10120 sensor for measurements&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Has a BCM to support charging/load sharing&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Includes two onboard LEDs to indicate power and charging status&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;USB-C port for power&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Headers for USB TTL communication (to flash) and to put into BOOT mode&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;background&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HopperHawk started as a project for myself, and I never intended on releasing it out into the world. It’s also the first project that involved building custom PCBs, so when I started out I went as simple as possible to reduce complexity and cost. The project gained some traction and more people were interested in it than I expected. After several iterations and hardware changes, it is finally in a place where I can share it with others!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Joe Pecsi</name><email>joe@sidelinedata.com</email></author><category term="news" /><summary type="html">Welcome!
